// Consumers parse files being edited, so recovering from many errors must stay linear: ten times the lines take about
// ten times as long, against a hundred times for quadratic recovery. The ratio catches a cost that grows faster than
// the input even on a slow CI runner; it would pass a parser that is uniformly slower, so the larger parse also has a
// generous ceiling, about 35 times the 0.06 s of CPU time it takes here. The parses are timed in the CPU time of the
// thread that runs them: wall-clock time is inflated unevenly by the test files running alongside, and the process's
// CPU time also counts the engine's background threads, which compile the Wasm build and collect garbage during the
// parses. 2,000 and 20,000 lines measured after warm-up parses and in alternation, each keeping its fastest run, give
// 10 to 13 locally; 18 leaves a margin over that and fails for growth faster than about n^1.25.
